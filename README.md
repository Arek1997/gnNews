# Before you start Impornant Note

In this app I use **free Developer API**.

These means API works **ONLY** in developer environment ( localhost ) but not after deploy f.g on netifly.

So i dont share link too netifly, you have to clone this repo.

Follow this instruction:

```
git clone https://github.com/Arek1997/gnNews.git
cd gnNews
npm i
npm run dev
```

Choose one of two available VITE_NEWS_API_KEY in .env file.

One should be already uncommented.

Countries which share own images or description are:

- Canada
- India
- Saudi Arabia
- South Africa
- Ukraine
- United Kingdom
- United States

The rest countries not share own images and descriptions so I use **THE SAME** images and descriptions as placeholder.
